Implementing a basic Neural Network for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
Steps:
1. Using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.
2. Preprocess the data (e.g., scaling pixel values).
3. Building and training a simple Neural Network with one or two hidden layers
using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
4. Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
